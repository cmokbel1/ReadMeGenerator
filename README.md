  ## Description 
  This project was built to allow myself and other users the opportunity to create a README.md file without the hassle of manually inputting the information needed. I struggled with creating the writeFile function but after some research and help from classmates I was able to scale the hurdles and push through. Learning Markdown syntax was also something very new to me, thankfully there are many websites to scour through for valuable information.
